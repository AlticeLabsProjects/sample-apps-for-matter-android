# Google Home Sample App for Matter

The **Google Home Sample App for Matter** (GHSA for Matter) provides a concrete example of how to
use the [Home Mobile SDK](https://developers.home.google.com/matter/eap/sdk/home-mobile) to make it
easy to commission and share [Matter](https://developers.home.google.com/matter/overview) devices
across Apps and ecosystems. It also demonstrates how to use commissioning and Cluster libraries
from the
[Matter repo (`connectedhomeip`)](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip).

This is a sample application that can be used as the starting point to build your
smart home application for Matter devices.

It can also be used as a learning tool to better understand key Matter concepts, as well as a tool
to debug and troubleshoot interactions with Matter devices.

> **Warning:** GHSA for Matter is currently restricted to EAP Partners. There is still work to be
> done on this sample app, but we are making it available at this point to allow partners to get a
> headstart on learning how to use the Home Mobile SDK.
